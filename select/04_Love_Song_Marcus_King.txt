I wanna write something special for you
Something to call your own
Bringing to light, its my message to you
I'm here to carve it in stone

You been my rock (My rock), you been my roll (My roll)
You been the light in the heart of my soul
Something so sweet (Sweet), I want you to know (To know)
I've never lived in a love song before

Hoo-hoo-hoo
Ooh-ooh, mm-hmm
Ooh-hoo

You came around at a time in my life
Time when I'd lost my mind
I heard the sound of your voice in the night
And I knew why true love was blind

You been my rock (My rock), you been my roll (My roll)
You been the light in the heart of my soul
Something so sweet (Sweet), I want you to know (To know)
I've never lived in a love song before

Something so sweet (So sweet), I don't want it to go (Go)
I've never lived in a love song before
Woo...
